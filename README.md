# Markyll
This project is still in progress. 

## Here's the idea:
I was annoyed by most presentation tools who
force you to use 10 buttons to create one title slide. 
Other tools such as reveal.js let you create slides based on HTML and CSS, but
those take away the focus of the content that matters.

Markyll will create the whole deck automatically for you, without having to
learn any new markdown syntax. 

```
# Slide One
- Hello world
- Hello computer
- Hello Cat

# Slide Two
This is anothe slide

## Sub slide!!

# Slide Three

This is the universe

<!-- and you can also use HTML instead of markdown -->
